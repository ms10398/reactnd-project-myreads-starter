# MyReads

A bookshelf built using React and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## Requirements
* npm

## How to Run:

1. Download or Clone the Repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.
4. App can be seen at: `localhost:3000`.

## Backend Server

The following file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/utils/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that are required to perform necessary operations on the backend:

### `getAll()`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update(book, shelf)`
* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search(query, maxResults)`
* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## create-react-app
